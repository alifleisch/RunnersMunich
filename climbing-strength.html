      <h2>A HOLISTIC APPROACH</h2>
      <p>
        The holistic approach of Munich Runners is built around three performance-focused pillars: 
        MINDSET, MOVEMENT AND STRETCHING. And to ensure no stone is left unturned to make 
        the best version of you a reality, these are supported by a fifth: GEAR. We offer a variety of 
        strength and climbing sessions with the aim of increasing our Munich Runners' quality of MOVEMENT. 
        Dedicated coaches are on hand at our Bases to advise on what, when and how to train. We improve

        in a runner's toolkit - their mental fortitude and sense of self-belief.
