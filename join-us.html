      <h2>JOIN A COMMUNITY TO BECOME A STRONGER INDIVIDUAL</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that each of our runners is only as strong as the community
        around them it's by coming together collectively that we're best able to
        achieve individual growth and success. Guidance, support, motivation,
        inspiration - these are the qualities that drive our community forward.
        Detach yourself from the maddening need go faster during every run: it
        is these qualities that sets adidas Runners apart from the rest, forging
        a true sense of belonging that resonates long after a run has ended.
